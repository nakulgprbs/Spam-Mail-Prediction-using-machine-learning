# Spam Mail Prediction using Machine learning 

## Introduction
This project is about predicting spam emails using machine learning. We use natural language processing (NLP) techniques and logistic regression to identify whether an email is spam or not.

## Dataset
The dataset should contain emails labeled as spam or not spam. It should be in a CSV file with two columns: one for the email text and one for the label.
