# Spam Mail Prediction using Machine learning 

## Introduction
This project is about predicting spam emails using machine learning. We use logistic regression to identify whether an email is spam or not.

## Dataset
The dataset should contain emails labeled as spam or not spam. It should be in a CSV file with two columns: one for the email text and one for the label.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification that models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It uses the logistic function to transform a linear combination of the input features into a probability value between 0 and 1.

## Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function)

The core of logistic regression is the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. This function maps any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], making it suitable for predicting probabilities.
